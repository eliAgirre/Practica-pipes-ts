# PracticaPipes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

I created some componentes and pipes:

`ng g component decimal-list`

`ng g pipe decimal-pipe`

`ng g component slice-list`

`ng g pipe slice-pipe`

`ng g component currency-list`

`ng g pipe currency-pipe`

`ng g component date-list`

`ng g pipe date-pipe`
